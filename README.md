#  Fruit Image Classification using CNN

A Deep Learning project that classifies fruit images into different categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **MobileNetV2** for efficient and accurate predictions.

---

##  Project Overview

This project aims to classify images of fruits into the following 5 categories:

- Apple   
- Banana   
- Grape  
- Mango  
- Strawberry 

We used **transfer learning** with MobileNetV2 for fast and efficient training and deployed the model using **Flask** with a user-friendly web interface.
